# Tumblr-User-Retention

## The idea of it was to try and figure out insights about user retention, and what were the best of ways of retaining usres, given those insights.

### What we learned about the data
####    The US outpaces the world in initial platform use and registration
####    A lot of them use Iphones – disproportionately so.
#### Users generally consumed content instead of engaging with it
#### Viewing pages and following had the highest correlations with other activities on the site
#### The web is important for signing up new users:
##### They are willing to convert to mobile platforms if they like the serivce

### Rentention seems to be correlated with
#### Size of Country User registered
#### Use of the platform within the first 24 hours – higher passive use of content led to more retention.

### Users that stayed with the service
#### Switched from Web to Mobile platforms
#### Spent most of their time passively browsing and liking content
